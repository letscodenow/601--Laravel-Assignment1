# 601--Laravel-Assignment1
Create a new Laravel project for making tasks list. 

- Create a database with two tables - users and tasks. 
- Create migrations and seed it with some dummy data. 
- Then create models for User and Task and connect them so that Task belongs to the User
- Creat a route to the home page where you are going to display the list of all tasks for particular user, and dropdown which will dsiplay all the users and when you change it it shoould display all the tasks for that user

Use on change event in jQuery to change the url so that it displays the appropriate user in GET. 
Make only basich HTML, no fancy CSS is required (but if you like, I willl appreciate it)
